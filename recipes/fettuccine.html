  <h1>Fettuccine Alfredo</h1>
  <img src="img/fettuccine.jpg">
  <p>I created this fettuccine Alfredo by modifying my mother's recipe. I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur, and he scrapes the pan every time. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious!</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul> 
  <li>24 ounces dry fettuccine pasta</li>
  <li>1 cup butter</li>
  <li>¾ pint heavy cream</li>
  <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>1 dash garlic salt</li>
  <li>¾ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
  <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
  <li>Melt butter into cream in a large saucepan over low heat; add salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Increase the heat to medium; stir in grated Romano and Parmesan cheese until melted and sauce has thickened.</li>
  <li>Add cooked pasta to sauce and toss until thoroughly coated; serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
